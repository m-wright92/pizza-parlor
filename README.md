# Pizza Parlor

#### By Mike Wright

#### A basic page to build a pizza and view the price.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
 
 ## Description

 This project is an exploration of JavaScript objects. It allows you to build a pizza, select the size and add up to 6 toppings, then it provides the price based off those factors.

 ## Setup Instructions

 * Clone repository from https://github.com/m-wright92/pizza-parlor
 * Navigate to the top level of the portfolio directory
 * Open index.html in your web browser (it has only been tested in Google Chrome)

 ## Known Bugs
If the user makes a selection in the first selector of meat or veggies, then selects another in the 2nd or 3rd place, if they set any selector before it back to "none" it will not properly calculate topping price.

Describe: Pizza(topping, size)

Test: "It should return a pizza object with an array of toppings and size"
Code: newPizza = new Pizza(['peperoni', 'jalapeno', 'olives'], "large");
Expected output: pizza {toppings: ['peperoni', 'jalapeno', 'olives'], size:'large'}


Describe: Pizza.prototype.topPriceCalc()

Test: "It should return a value based off # of toppings in the pizza object array"
Code: newPizza = new Pizza(['peperoni', 'jalapeno', 'olives'],   "large", 0)
      newPizza.topPriceCalc();
Expected output: 3


Describe: Pizza.prototype.sizePriceCalc()

Test: "It should return a value based off size of pizza"
Code: newPizza = new Pizza(['peperoni', 'jalapeno', 'olives'], "large", 0);
      newPizza.sizePriceCalc();
Expected output: 20

Describe: Order();

Test: "This will create an order object to hold the pizza objects"
Code: newOrder = new Order("Pizza1);
      newOrder;
Expected Output: OrderÂ {pizza: 'Pizza1'}


Describe: Order.prototype.addPizza();

Test: "This will add a pizza object to the order"
Code: newPizza = new Pizza(['peperoni', 'jalapeno', 'olives'], "large", 0);
      newOrder = new Order();
      newOrder.addPizza(newPizza);
      newOrder;
Expected Output: pizzas: {1: Pizza}


Describe: Order.prototype.assignId();

Test: "This will give an ID for pizzas"
